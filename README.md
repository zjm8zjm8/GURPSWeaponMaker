# GURPSWeaponMaker
Randomly generates GURPS melee weapons.

#### About

I have been playing GURPS for a year now, and as a GM, I find myself wanting a little variety in the weapons that I give my players.
This is an attempt to build an easily modified, balanced weapon generator.

If this winds up working well, I'll make a potion generator, an arrow generator, etc.

If you want to clone this to modify the lists, be my guest.

I'm always open to suggestions, and if you have any, shoot me an email at zjm8zjm8@gmail.com.
